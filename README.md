# 📧 Email/SMS Spam Detection

This repository contains a **Spam Classifier** that detects whether an email or SMS message is **Spam** or **Not Spam**. The application uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to preprocess the input message and classify it using a pre-trained machine learning model.

## 📖 Introduction
Spam messages in emails and SMS are a widespread problem. This project aims to provide a solution by classifying a given text message as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using Machine Learning (ML) models. The web interface for this classifier is built using **Streamlit**.

The underlying model was trained using NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and vectorization using TF-IDF, which enables the classifier to understand the content of the messages and make predictions.

## ✨ Features
- Input a message and classify it as **Spam** or **Not Spam**.
- Utilizes NLP techniques for text preprocessing.
- Easy-to-use web interface built with Streamlit.
- Displays a clear and interactive user interface with results.

## 💻 Technologies Used
This project was built using the following technologies:
- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web application.
- **scikit-learn**: For vectorizing the text (TF-IDF) and training the classification model.
- **nltk**: For Natural Language Processing tasks such as tokenization and stemming.
- **pickle**: For saving and loading the trained model and TF-IDF vectorizer.

## 🛠 Installation
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-spam-classifier.git
   cd email-spam-classifier
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   You can install the necessary libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If the `requirements.txt` is not available, you can manually install them:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit nltk scikit-learn pickle-mixin
   ```

3. **Download NLTK dependencies**:
   You need to download some essential NLTK packages:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('punkt')
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   Start the Streamlit app using the command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   The app will open in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 🚀 Usage
Once the application is running, follow these steps:
1. **Input the message** you want to classify in the text area.
2. Click the **"Classify Message"** button.
3. The app will process your input using NLP techniques and classify it as **Spam** or **Not Spam**.
   
You will see a message with a label like **🔴 Spam** or **🟢 Not Spam**.

## ⚙️ Model Training
The model used in this project is a binary classifier that predicts whether a message is spam or not. Below is an overview of the steps followed to train the model:

1. **Preprocessing**: The input text is preprocessed using the following steps:
   - Convert to lowercase.
   - Tokenize the text.
   - Remove stopwords and punctuation.
   - Apply stemming using Porter Stemmer.

2. **Vectorization**: 
   - Text data is converted into numerical features using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**.

3. **Classification Model**: 
   - A machine learning model (e.g., **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**) is trained to classify the message.
   - The trained model and TF-IDF vectorizer are saved using `pickle` for future use.

## 📊 Dataset
For this project, we used a publicly available spam detection dataset. The dataset contains labeled messages (spam or not spam) and was used to train the classifier.
